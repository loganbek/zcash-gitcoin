Prize Title
Onramping documentation for Zcash developers

Challenge Description
Zcash documentation assumes the visitor to have a high degree of knowledge about Zcash, and has a focus towards technical API solutions/instructions.

Suggested submission topics:

introduction to Zcash-specific basic concepts
when to use a full node for development and specific resources/requirements
when to use a light client for development and specific resources/requirements
Submission Requirements
Submit a markdown (.md) or restructured text (.rst) file of the documentation, along with any images/media used, if any.
It doesn't need to be perfect or complete! We will post-process the documentation and take it from here. The most valuable information is what you needed to know while hacking.
